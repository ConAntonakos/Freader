Freader
=======

Now that Google Reader is over, why not use an open source Feed Reader !
Freader provide you a simple page with all your feeds and the last item in them.
You cannot read articles inside the application for now but it's on the TODO list !

Features
--------

* All your feeds in a clear (and flat) UI
* User managment (creation, removing)
* Feed caching (one hour by default)
* All written with Node.js and Angular.js for a awesome speed

Requirement
-----------

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)

Installation
------------

* Clone this repo
* Start your MongoDB server (modify the adress if you need in the config file)
* Start the server with 'npm start'
* You can now create a user and start adding feeds by connecting to localhost:3000 (you can change the port inside the config file)

Used
----

* [Angular.js](http://angularjs.org/)
* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)
* [FlatUI by Designmodo](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/)

TODO
----

* Add organization on feeds with tabs / categories
* Get back the favicon from the feed if any
* Clean all CSS and removing Bootstrap / Flat UI to keep only what's used
